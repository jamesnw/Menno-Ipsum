a kiss of brotherly love
ate zweibach
baptizing them
bridges to the cross
bringing forth firstfruits
compassionate peacemaking
decision by consensus
devout servitude
don't own a TV
gelassenheit
healing and hope
healing the world
in the world, but not of it
joining together
joyfully following Jesus
let's come to agreement
let's delegate
longing for a greater experience
make a committee
make disciples
making More with Less
my 7 roommates
my Amish cousins
opt for believer's baptism
pass the peace
peace by peace
servant leadership
share with each other
singing hymns
teach all nations
the Anabaptist Vision
the Silent in the land
the third way
what we are called to do in the face of
who are the Mennonites
